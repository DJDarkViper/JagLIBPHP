Added the fledgling classes to start, these will be worked on and constantly evolving over time. 


Explanation:

/classes/databasedriver.class.php
This is a CodeIgniter inspired database class, utilizes method stringing to quickly create and mould SQL Queries together.
This is still in ALPHA phase and should not be utilized in a production setting unless your comfortable fixing some bugs

/classes/paypal.class.php
An older class (one of my first ever real useful classes actually) that creates a PayPal Form based on information fed into it.
Allows you to add items to the temporary "cart", and generate the form. Also includes code to automatically submit said form
if you wish to totally customize the full experience.
This is classified as STABLE but BETA, and will be completed rewritten soon to follow the same formula as its NVP counterpart. (below)

/classes/paypalnvp.class.php
A newer class of mine that utilizes the PayPal NVP API for real-time credit card transaction processing. Includes full
error reporting, this is considered STABLE but still in BETA.

/classes/form.class.php
An older class of mine (newer than the older paypal class though) that allows you to build customized forms without HTML, but use PHP
to generate the form fields. 
This is in ALPHA and not production safe, and will be rewritten soon.

/classes/email.class.php
Allows you create emails and send to multiple accounts at once, including CC and BCC. I made this class a day after i finished the
old paypal class, and desperately needs an update. But it is classified as STABLE and good to use (I've used it plenty of times)
